Five files are included.

136_panel_with_4lts.fa:
  The alignment of 136-virus-panel plus (1) the refence sequence (HXB.2, the
  first sequence), and (2) antigen sequence in Env:VRC01 strucgture (4LTS).

vrc01_ic50.txt
  IC50 from neutralizaiton experiment (VRC01, 136-virus panel).

vrc01_wts.4lts.txt
  Weight to capture the contribution of each antigen site's contribution in
  the binding of VRC01.

BLOSUM62.txt
  BLOSUM62 score matrix.

4lts_with_w.pdb
