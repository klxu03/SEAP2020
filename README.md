# SEAP2020
> This repository is a documentation of my progress and code that I have written so far for my 2020 summer internship with WRAIR as a part of the SEAP Program. 

## How to Use
### Installing the necessary packages
* Inside, there is a requirements.txt file where you can simply create a python virtual environment and download all the necessary python packages with
``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```
